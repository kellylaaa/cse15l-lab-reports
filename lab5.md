# Lab Report 5

My favorite lab report was lab report 3 which was finding serveral different commands-line options for "find". This lab was useful to learn as it would
help find different files or information in a file. A useful tool I used for this lab report was Chatgbt because I would ask it to give me different 
command line options and it would provide me a list of commands for "find" and a desciption of what each command did. With the given list of commands,
I tested them on VS code terminal while in the "written_2" directory. I was able to test out each command and see how they would apply to the files in
that directory. A command I used was "find -name" and I used it by typing in "find -name" and the name of the file I wanted. This command was useful
because it would help me find all the files with a certain name throughout the directory. Another command I found was "find -type" and to use it I inputted 
"find -type" and the type of files I wanted. If I wanted to find all the directories in the "written_2" directory, I would input: "find . -type d" and 
this would give me a list of all the directories. The commands I learned through this lab report gave me a deeper understanding of the command "find" which 
was helpful in later assignments.
